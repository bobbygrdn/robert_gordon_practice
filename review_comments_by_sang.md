# Review comments by Sang

We are going to use this as a basis for
weekly 1-1.

## April 13 (Thursday)
- .gitignore is missing
- "employee-app"
    - part #3 is done successfully
    - Use of currentIndex of an array would be a better code rather than checking null in the array
    - HRClient does not display department's total compensation

## April 17 (Monday morning)
- "employee_app" looks good up to part #5
- "sba_exercise" looks good up to part #6
